    <h2>What is Net Neutrality?</h2>
    <p> Internet service providers treat all data on the Internet equally,
      and not discriminate or charge differently by user, content, website,
      platform, application, type of attached equipment, or method of communication.
    These regulations can be referred to as "common carrier" regulations.
     This does not block all abilities that Internet service providers have
     to impact their customer's services. Opt-in/opt-out services exist on the
     end user side, and filtering can be done on a local basis, as in the filtration
     of sensitive material for minors. Net neutrality regulations exist only to
      protect against misuse...

      <h2>Net neutrality rules are now repealed: What it means</h2>
      <p>Net Neutrality is a principle affirming that all Internet Service
        Providers must treat all data on the internet equally. They must
        not discriminate against certain services, users, content, applications,
         or methods of communication. Under Net Neutrality regulations, an internet
         service provider is not allowed to intentionally block, nor slow down
         specific content or websites. The net neutrality rules were approved by
         the FCC in 2015 amid an outpouring of online support. The intention was
         to keep the internet open and fair...

      <h2>How to Explain Why Net Neutrality Matters to Your Friends Who Don't Get It</h2>
      <p>The internet should be treated as a utility, like
        electricity. Every companies should be managed by certain regulations. And
         the regulations must be the same for all the companies, whatever their
         influences. Net neutrality protects people from online censorship because
          it stop internet providers from blocking websites they disagree with. Removing
          these laws would open up the internet to all kinds of censorship.Also, influential
          providers may block the use of other providersâ€™ service and making them impossible
          to compete in the future. And what kind of service we used everyday will be decided
          by those big companies...
